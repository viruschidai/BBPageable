BBPageable
=====================

Pageable Backbone Collections.

##Server side pageable

Each page is requested from server. You need to program you server side to
support pagination.

###live example

##Client side pageable

All data loaded at once. It is great for smaller data sets. For example, if you
only have a few thousands records, it might be faster to load all request in one
request. You can also bootstrap all data with html to reduce the number of
request and also make you application more responsible.
